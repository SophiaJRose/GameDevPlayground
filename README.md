# GameDevPlayground

This project is a playground for me to develop and toy around with any game development ideas I've had, in my spare time. Any ideas developed here are not necessarily connected to each other in any way, nor are they necessarily anything I would pursue a larger project with.

Assets used in this project are a mix of my own assets, and assets pulled from [Kenney Game Assets All-In-1](https://kenney.itch.io/kenney-game-assets).
